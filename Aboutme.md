I am a 15 year old, Monke, of course. I am a semi-expirienced developer. I work in things like HTML, CSS, JS, TS, and some PHP.
Ive been working in deveopment for about 3 months. And It has been a expierence and a half. So lets go over all of my time. 

#### Day 1

On day 1 it was very very rough. I was playing MCPE and played on this network called Versai. This showed me what is possible. And I decided
to go for the Developer role there. I really wanted to learn how to make a cool plugin. So I started in PHP, I went hard. ANd was really...
really go... Bad. I was really bad, didnt know anything. I hopped into a VC with someone named [Brady](https://github.com/0x00032).
Brady is the main person that kept me motivated. People were telling me that I was very bad, and should quit. I went through this though.
Brady walked me through making a simple plugin that would send a message when someone joined the game. I learned alot in this and knew,
I really really wanted this.

#### Day 8

Within about a week. I had only still made that plugin i got walked through on. I spent the week sitting, reading through code, and looking,
looking throught the PMMP discord, watching as all the pros make there things. This really fasinated me, I then went and tryed to make something
more complex... Kits, I wanted to learn how to make arguments in a command. This was something i had seen before, but didnt fully understand how.
Kits really set me off, and then I kind of stoped with that.

<hr>

I went about 2 weeks without making anything or touching coding, but it was all I could think about. Then I recived a message. I was on
the Build team, Survival team, And Trainee on Versai at this time. When I got a message from the owner Sue. This changed my life as a 
developer. It went something like this.
<br>
"@TLS Gorilla psst..." - Sue
<br>
"Are you free?" - Sue
<br>
"uhh yes?" -TLS
<br>
"I wouldnt mind having more survival servers, go look for mods and we can make one" - Sue 
<br>
<br>
This is what it said somewhat, in a nutshell. And it threw me off. I thought she ment to go through and pick up new MODERATORS. I was 
very very confused about this. Then she told me that it was meant to be modded survival. This was when they told me we would use BDSx.
BDSx is a minecraft bedrock + Node JS. It was all in TypeScript, and we could make custom commands, and also add mods. THIS is when I
really started to learn about programming in MCBE. I was working with [Martin](https://github.com/mzztin) and making things that I 
never thought possible. At this time I was new to TS and I didnt know JS so it was rough. I was really really happy that I got put onto
this though. Martin did most of the development of the plugins, While I modified some of the mod packs. This was the most fun ever.

#### Day before release (supposedly)

We had made a plugin that would make it so people could get a starter kit, but we couldnt get it to work. This is when I just said "I will
do it with some command blocks." When I was doing the command blocks, Sue and some other guy joined the game. I wasnt sure why they joined.
Sue then said that this is a new person that I will be working with. At first i was very sceptical, I liked working with Martin, and it
was alot of fun. I asked who they were and Sue awnsered me "This is cadet someone who is going to help you on modded." I didnt want it at
first, but he joined, and then helped fix some of the problems we were having. This is when we pushed modded release back a little further
so we can fix all the last minute bugs.

### Release Day

This is the day where we realesed Modded survival, we had hyped it up ALOT in the community and people were super exited to play,
the problem was it was super laggy, and it was no fun to play. This is when we would reset it and remove some of the mods, to help with the lag.
Cadet then started to make a new branch, essentially rewriting all of the plugin, and making it new, he made a new API, and this is what
really made me start to understand TypeScript.

#### Today

Today I am working on making some addons for modded, when we update, I am also working on making a new plugin, with Gangs. It is one of the
hardest projects that I have ever taken on and I amd very ready for it. To this day I am still trying to figure out how to get JSON
to communicate with TS in the way I need. Without [Cadet](https://github.com/Cqdet) I wouldnt know as much today as I do. Im also 
working on my Website development and other fun stuff. And that brings us to the modern day.
