# Languages

As you may know I am a developer and work in some departments. I mainly work in Website Development, and also Minecraft Development.
I work in multiple languages and am wanting to learn alot more about them ad learn more languages!
Ive been working for about 1-2 months now part time and am really loving it! In my opinion im learning fast and picking up alot of things!

## Language Info

#### TypeScript

I have been working with type script for about 2 months! I am learning it for alot of things, and making minecraft plugins with it!
This is probably my favorite language to work in and my most comfortable language to work in! I am really in love with it and dont know
what I would be doing today if it wernt for TypeScript.

#### PHP

Ah yes... The elephant in the room, PHP. *hahahah* I know im very funny. Anyways, I've been working in PHP for about 2 and 1/2 months in
PMMP and have really enjoyed it. alot of people dont like php, but personally I love it, I think that it is really nice to learn
and it has been fun to sit down and learn about it.

#### JavaScript

JavaScript is something that ive not really worked in before, I know its a bad thing but i just jumped into TypeScript. Recentlly I have
Been leaning JavaScript so that I can improve my TypeScript as well. In this language I mainly do Discord Bots and Minecraft Bedrock addons.
I find JavaScript to be kind of fun, and somewhat simple and realy really enjoy the expierence. I have also been wanting to learn varients of this such as React and Vue, so that i can use it to become better at Web development and not just web design.

#### HTML + CSS

Ive grouped HTML and CSS together because you really cant have one without the other. Ive been doing HTML for quite a long time. And i would say im pretty good at it. I know alot of the tags and sub-tags (thats what i call them). And then theres CSS. Alot of people say i waste my time learning CSS and should use Bootstrap. But personally I like to use CSS alot, and would prefer CSS over anything else.

## Learning Languages

#### C++

C++ seems to be a hard language to me. Im wanting to learn C++ because it seems to be something that could be useful. And I also am wanting to learn alot of languages and have them set. Im learning this to the side, as I am still perfecting all the other languges.

#### Python

Oh boy... python. In my opinion, python is terrible, i hate how simple it is, and how it is so indent driven and if you miss a indent or acidentally indent it wont work. The syntax as well is very annoying to me there are no ; to break up the lines at all and just in general i font like the language.
