# My TypeScript Expierence

When I fisrt started to use TypeScript, I was terrible, I didnt know basic JavaScript, wich made this extra hard. I always was told that I should go and learn how to do JS before I
jump into TS. But I didnt because im a stubborn monke. This made it more challenging and I absolutley hated it at times, but what did I do, asked for help. People then would help me and then
I would put it into what I was working on and then, I would sit there, read it, anyalize it, and learn what EXACTLLY was happening and how it works. TypeScript is a JS superset, wich means
any valid JS code is valid TS. Now towards the middle of my expierence so far I had begun to make some small things on my own, and it became very fun because i didnt have to ask for help
every time I needed something done. When we get to present dya.. I just think, Wow, this is amazing. Im still asking people about things, but mainly asking "does this work?" and 
im starting to get alot more yes. This is nice because that means im getting better. its truely amazing how far ive came with Typescript, and im very proud of myself for it. If you
want more stories I do know how to write in fiction and im very good at it so you can just star this and I will make a journal almost, and write you all a story about monke of course.
